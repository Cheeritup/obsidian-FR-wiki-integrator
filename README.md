# Forgotten Realms Wiki Intergration Plugin

*Readme is still W.I.P.*

This plugin enables importing articles from the Forgotten Realms Wiki into your obsidian vault.

Please do keep in mind currently the only category of infobox tables supported are "Location". In other words the visual infoboxes will only appear for locations for now.

## Requirements
For the plugin to work correctly you must make sure you have the following plugins installed:

-"Quick Links"(https://github.com/iafisher/obsidian-quick-links)

-"Dataview"(https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview)

You also must be using the ITS Theme. (for now)
## Installation

-Install BRAT(https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) on your desired obsidian vault using the in-app community plugins browser.

-In your BRAT settings inside of Obsidian click on "Add Beta Plugin" and paste the repository link(https://github.com/Cheeritup/obsidian-FR-wiki-integrator) click "Add Plugin".
## Usage
Go to a desired Forgotten Realms Wiki(https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) article, click on the "Edit" button on the top right. After it is done loading click on the newly appeared "Visual Editor" button and change into "Source Editing".

Copy and paste all of the source code into an empty note in your vault. Make sure you're in markdown view and select all of the source code with CTRL+A, then using either a hotkey or the command pallete run the command "Fix Source Code".


It is highly recommended to setup a hotkey for the command in the settings. (default suggestion is ALT+V or ALT+S)
